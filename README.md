# DIIG-Sp24

The DIIG Data Division empowers clients to achieve their maximum potential by providing data-driven solutions to their business questions. Our team partnered with SunCast Media.

SunCast Media is a guiding voice in the solar revolution, hosted by Nico Johnson, a podcaster, investor, and coach that brings 16+ years of experience in solar & clean energy.

The code files contained comprise one section of this project, focused on content analysis (i.e., what content performs best). More specifically, the code leverages the YouTube API and Selenium/Beautiful Soup to scrape data from YouTube and LinkedIn. This is followed by keyword and media type analyses, supplemented by visualizations.

A slide deck is also included, which contains all aspects of this project (audience analysis, content analysis, competitor analysis, and follower classification).
